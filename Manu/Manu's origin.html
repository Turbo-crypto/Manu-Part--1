 <h1>Manu's quest</h1>
 <p>
  EPILOGUE
There once was a boy named Manu. He was 18 years old, had dark skin and lived in a village known as lokini which meant hidden heart. Manu was a gifted boy who was curious of his environment. He wanted to know more than he was told about what was beyond his small little village. In his village there was a heiracy system that was put in place. The ranking was King, followed by elders, followed by clans men and women, teachers of knowledge, builders, mages, merchants, adventurers, cooks, cleaners.
Manu lived alone in a house nearby a river. He enjoyed hearing the rain drops fall there. He was a bit of a loner. In the village each person was given a choice on what field of work they wished to partake in. They would learn a skill and use it to contribute to the village and in return would receive credits for their effort, these credits could be exchanged for products they wished to purchase in the village.
Manu picked the builders class. In this class you could create tools, forge equipment, and create anything you wished, this class required the imagination of the builder for the intended action. 
For the sake of earning credits Manu chose to specialize in forging tools for adventures, cleaners, and elders. 
The builder’s guild had a ranking system of their own. The head was the guild master, followed by the lieutenant, followed by the captains of 5 classes, then classes, 1st to 5th. When you enter the guild you start in 5th class. You can rank up by completing tasks and gaining experience. 
Manu started in 5th class. He was under the instruction of captain Gear head. For his first task Manu was told to build a tool for cleaners that specialized in cleaning dirty toilets. He was told he would only require the use of his mana, a scrubbing brush, a power gem, and an activation key.
The captain left Manu in the guild builder room to his devices. At first Manu couldn’t really understand what he needed to do. How was he supposed to put a scrubbing brush, power gem and an activation key together. He needed to do some research. First he had to find out what exactly were power gems, mana and activation keys/spells. 
The builder guild had a library, Manu had been given a map of the builder guild. He needed to follow the directions only and he would find his way. The map showed Manu he needed to make a few turns and he would get to the place, on his way he passed by other rooms filled with guild members, there was a bar / eating lounge, bath rooms for females and males and one that allowed for mixed baths, a training room, a kitchen, a shopping room, a male and female section for personal rooms and an entertainment room. 
After passing the different rooms he finally came across the library, it was huge. It seemed like a city filled with books. The librarian’s desk was just close to the entrance. There was a lady sited at the desk reading a book. Manu walked towards her and she reflexively put on a charming smile while she put aside the book she was reading. [Manu] Hello, my name is Manu. I recently joined the builder guild and am currently looking for learning resources to complete a task I have been given. Can you assist me? say
She didn’t seem like she would say no, she seemed rather interested in answering my question.
[Receptionist] I see, welcome to the guild archives Maru. My name is Alice hunter, but you can just call me Alice. To begin using the services of the archives you will need to create an account with us, I will require your guild membership id and your signature to get started. 
She replied with a warm smile, I sensed a bit of amusement in her reply. I pulled out the member ship card I had created by the guild registration receptionist’s desk. It was a black card with neon blue lights. It held the image of my face and details of my attributes, name, skills, level and experience.  
I handed her the card and she replied with an oh how nice.
She took a quick look and decided in a few seconds that it was valid and genuine. Her eyes were a color of light green and seemed to give off a hidden focus that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.
[Receptionist] Lets see, you seem to be under captain GEAR HEAD of the 5th class. You’re a builder named Manu Garnet. You seem to be level one with no experience at all. Well that is understandable seeing as this is your first day. You have good health and defensive attributes, your special skills are stealth and forging, and you seem to have an extra special skill of creator. These are moderately decent skills in the hands of an average person but if you study hard and build yourself up you might grow to be a quite interesting fellow. 
Well, everything seems to be in-order. Il hand you a document for you to sign.
She waved her hand and a white piece of paper appeared with a white glow onto her desk.  She handed it to me along with a pen. The paper felt real in my hands even though It seemed to appear out of thin air. It felt a little warm and a little soft to the touch. On it were a few words that read “Do you Manu Garnet” agree to the terms and conditions stated below? Write your name in the blank box to agree.
[Manu]: I read through the document’s terms and conditions. It seemed to mostly focus on the fine line of the guild not being responsible for any damages that might occur due to the actions of the guild member regarding the usage of documents provided in the library archives. I took the pen into my right hand, it was light and oddly transparent. When I placed it onto the document and started writing, the ink it producing was strange. It was like I was writing orange fiery letters onto the paper, it was smooth and flawless as I moved the letters along while writing my name. When I was done the pen vanished with a pop sound into nothingness. I looked towards miss hunter and saw a pleased look in her eyes. She gestured her hand towards me signaling herself ready to receive the document. I picked it up and passed it towards her. She seemed to scan it decided on my registration being complete. 
[Alice] Congratulations Manu Garnet. Your registration is complete. I will hand you an instruction manual and give you a partial explanation on how the library archives work. Please stretch your left hand towards me. 
I stretched my left hand and in an instant she had grabbed it with her right. Her grip was not crushing but it wasn’t soft either. She then only said a few words next. This might hurt a bit.
For an instant that felt like minutes I felt a striking electric current flow through my body. In that moment I couldn’t move nor think as I felt as though every cell in my body was burning. The moment came when she let go and all the pain left my body.
[Alice] I have just infused a fraction of my energy into your body. This will allow you to interact with my library as you wish. The moment you leave this library is the moment the energy I have transferred to you returns back to me. It is a temporary contract that only applies when you are within these walls. Simply speak out loud what information or documents you wish to use and I will deliver them remotely to any desk you wish to use.
[Manu] I could not understand her for the first seconds after the shock, it sounded as though she were speaking in a different language from the one she started with.
