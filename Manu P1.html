 <h1>WHERE TO FIND A GIRL IN GLASSES.</h1>
 
 <p>

   
 
  Shortly after registering my initials with the <abbr title="librarian beauty">LB</abbr> i proceeded towards my initial task. I needed to create a tool that would allow me to clean a toilet efficently in a way that was uncommon to your average janitor. I headed within the library and picked a desk close to the entrance.Picking a spot i would sneak a peak at the mystery lady while i tired of research was an interesting idea. I picked a table, it was fairly wide and had four chairs surrounding it's four sides. The desk was a glass like transparent structure with grid like white linings streaming within it.</p>

 <hr/>

  
  <p>The chairs were slightly different. They were textured in a charcoal black material. When i picked one and sat, it felt cool and soft. In a few seconds it seemed to 
  shift it's structure into a wider version of itself, as if it was designed to suit the required size of the individual sitting on it. I got comfortable and reached for the table. As the librarian had explained, her library was partially automated. This meant work involving managing the thousands of records had been reduced by the 
  aid of <strong> systems that she had put in place.</strong></p>
  
  <p>I placed my hand wide on the table and shortly after a voice greeted me. <br/>
  Strange voice: Greetings Manu Garnet. I am <em>Red Rose</em>, but you can just call me Rose. I am here to assist you in fetching any documents you might require from the library repositories.</p>
  
  <p>Me saying i was taken aback and a little startled was an understatement. What appeared ahead of me on the table was a girl. She was red haired and had skin that matched
  her hair color, almost as though she was the embodiment of the fire element. She wore a black top and had ripped jeans on her lower body, she had a punky posture as
  she sat on the table with her bare feet. </p>
  After a few seconds i recovered from my amazement at the uncommon spectacle before my eyes, i replied telling her i needed some documents containing information on how
  to use power gems, scrabbing brushes and activation keys.
  After observing and listening carefully she broke off into a crazed laughter entirely ignoring all rules in a library demanding silence, she was practically in tears as she lost herself in a bliss i could not truly understand. 
  Rose: I see, old gear head still hasn't lost his humour. Okay, rookie..il give you an introduction to what youre looking for.
  In a few moments she stretched out her left hand and told me to hold on tight. Taking her outstretched hand as an invitation towards something i suspected she had planned as a sort of instructor i moved my right hand to meet her's. The moment our hands met the space around me seemed to blur.
  
  <h2>VOLUME 1: PATH OF SEEKER </h2>
  
  <h1>Chapter 1: RED</h1>
  
  Some say you never know what you have till its gone, but what if you were never meant to know what you have before it leaves you, what if you were meant to travel in ignorance with the most precious gem you could ever be in the company of till you parted ways without even knowing you parted ways with it. 
  The red haired lady was saying something that seemed to be taken from a book i would probably never read, she was still holding onto my right hand with her right, her
  eyes were glowing an emerald red and the space around us was distorting as though we were being slowly shifted into a different reality from the one we were in. It was getting harder to breath, the air around us was getting thinner, it felt as though an unknown force was squeezing my body from all angles, i felt that perhaps this was a good time to let go of this poetic charismatic charming punky cutish red haired lady, as though reading my mind she stiffend her grip making any form of escape unreachable.
  Rose: Wow, hold it right there tiger...if you let go right there you would have ended up in the zero world, guy like you in there would be alut rudy on my part. Now then, repeat after me so that we get through in one piece..red shared green crystals with black range catalyst, don't think just say it..il explain later.
  
  
  My mouth seemed to move on it's own, in a moment i found myself back on the table from whatever place i had been with Rose. Everything was back to normal, she was no longer holding my hand, i was nolonger out of breath, no longer getting crushed. The strange part was not the bizare events that had happened just a moment ago but the feeling of non of it ever happening to begin with, even though it did. There was no fear, no anxiety, no panic, just peace.
  
  Rose: Hmm, nice reaction. Seems the process was a success, that was a sort of screening process everyone has to go through around here, can't be too careful, you'll learn why eventually for now il just pass on the rights, you don't need to understand at the moment. Just rock n roll baby, you've got to roll with the rock while you're mining for babes in the rocks. 
  
  I couldn't really make sense out of some of what she had just said but one thing had changed from the time everything went back to normal, in my hand now was a rock, I did not know when it got in my hand, it was thick and was the size of a fist..glowing red scarlet like the eyes of the lazy eyed Red haired girl sitted on my table. 
  
  
  <h1>LINK: TWISTED FATE</h1>
  
  Rose: Hey, you've really caught yourself a grand nutter right there. These don't just pop out of the horned zoo these cycles. You'll be loaded if you cash it in but
  that would be a shame really, i recommend keeping it till your last breath on this rock.
  
  She spoke while inspecting the new piece of material that lay in my hand.
  
  Rose: Okay, this babe seems ideal. You should be the one to name your new rock baby.
  
  Tuesday, October 25, 2022 Time: 16:45
  
  Sitting in felt strange, i had the desire to stand so i did. The glowing red jewel seemed to radiate a certain feeling as i held it. It felt warm and heavy for the size it held. When i applied preasure on it i felt as though the veins in my hand were being set ablaze, as though a fire was moving through my blood to all the parts of my body. In less than 30 seconds i was ingulfed in a flame coloured scarlet. The clothes on me did not burn and my body seemed to react as though the flame around me was an extension of myself because i felt no pain and stood unharmed by the fires flowing around me.
  
  Rose: I see, you seem to be compatible with the element. If you weren't you would have been burnt to a crisp. Though i had scanned you in advance to check just to be safe. Coolie, now let us proceed to your education. School is cool when you are actively learning afterall. Lets see.
  
  She pulled out of thin air a document that seemed to be glowing in an orange emissive color. And began to read me the contents.
  
  Rose: Manu Garnet, says here that you are supposed to make a toilet cleaning thingy using the jewel you just picked up. Use the elemental attribute and fuse it with a construct that will ensure an easier method of cleaning a toilet from the normal methods used by cleaners. So, you'll need a toilet..a cleaning thingy or things and a jewel. Using a toilet thats already available would be boring. I advise you create the required materials excluding the jewel which is as easy as making a mini star if you get the hint..though you'll be able to make one if you like after enough research and practice. For now as your guide i require you to make a toilet and toilet cleaning stuffs. To do this you will need to learn the object modelling creator art. With the aid of the jewel you will have enough power to form the objects into the forms required. Okay lets move to a new area within, hold onto my hand tight and try not to look down if you can.
  
  Manu: After listening to Rose's explanation i felt i was closer to getting done with the first of my assignments. With all the events that had taken place in such a short space of time i felt a slight burst of excitement that was whelling up inside of me. I had a desire to learn more from Rose, so i didn't really think twice when she invited my hand on an unknown path towards another episode of Road to wierd worlds part 2. I reached out my hand towards her's and when i was within her reach i felt a slight breeze touch my fingers, it felt cool and refreshing. 
  
  Tuesday, November 8, 2022 Time: 01:05
  
  Manu: Numb, i felt numb from my toes to my face. In a few seconds the temperature had flown downwards towards the minus ranges i would guess. The previous fiery babe holding my right hand had been replaced my a blue girl. Simply blue, her eyes glowed a thunderly white, her hair flowed like a stream of white threads and her hand was cold as the ice on pluto's surface. I couldn't get free, my instincts were telling me i needed to escape, every fiber of my being was screaming get away now as the ice slowly crept along my fingers she wispered in a voice that felt like many mixed into one for a brief moment.
  Blue: Greetings mortal, we are blue rose. Red will not acknowledge us therefore we are here, this has not entirely transpired yet for the laws are not linear. Hear us, for you will need what is heard now, we require aid so we will assist you and in turn you assist us. Her appetite is rich, she wishes to devour you when the time is right, to prevent your demise we offer you a path. Seek the halo, seek the mind guard. We reach you again if you succeed.
  
  In what seemed like a moment in eternity ended i was back in the library holding red's hand. She had a puzzled look as though she were trying to make sense of an event she found bizare.
  
  Rose: You, did you just go somewhere else for a brief moment? Your presence, i couldn't feel you for a moment. 
  
  Manu: Her eyes seemed as though they were scanning every cell of my body, trying to find an answer to her burning questions. But she could not find them, for some reason it felt as though a boundary had been placed between us that was not present some moments ago. Her face lost all form of sarcasm and laziness, she was as still as a statue and did not blink. Her eyes seemed to glow slightly more intensly than i had seen as of now. After a few seconds she seemed to close her eyes and relax her posture, almost as though she had given up her search and decided to go on a vacation to a beach in the middle of nowhere.
  
  Rose: Whatever, they tend to interfere once in awhile. Okay, listen rookie. Its against the rules for me to ask you about blue so keep it to yourself, don't ask me how i know, for now we will proceed. Honestly am bummed out, they are just lonely kids after all. 
  
  I reckon she mentioned i was planned on eating you. Well she isn't off, my race tend to do that sometimes but i have chosen to deviate from standard behaviour for the sake of my individuality. Can't do better than the truth after all. If you don't want to continue receiving lessons from me then i will understand, you can be assigned another instructor if you wish. Though it would be slightly unfortunate, i rarely get compatible students these cycles. But i am in no mood to start explaining the dangers and rewards that come with being my student, blue tends to irritate every cell within me for some reason. 
  Il make it simple for you. Instructors are placed within ranks, i am alittle higher than your basic gear head sensei. You can call me a lucky roll on your wheel of fortune, high risk high reward is what i am known for. If you want to raise your skills like mad am your girl, though i might blow you up in the process is the catch.
  So what will it be rookie, will you trust me with your life in return of a wild adventure? or will you not?     
  Manu: She seemed cheerful even at a time i was being offered a cross road. On one side i would avoid my own demise due to unknown forces. On the other side i would simply choose the safer route that had me learning at a stable rate, i would probably excell and slowly reach advanced ranks in time if i worked hard enough, then i would probably earn a reasonable fortune after enough years of work and saving which would allow me to acquire the right materials need to go on my journey.
  But the girl standning infront of me was an unseen route. One i wouldn't come across again if i strayed now. 
  
  While i do value stability am a sucker for alittle bit of mystery aswell. What is the best way to go through this life? Is it to simply use the crowd route? Surely the path is very rewarding but it has limited freedom. You can't truly live as you wish in a crowd, because a crowd has it's own will, it's own thoughts, it's own conciousness. In a crowd you do not live for yourself but for the crowd itself, there is no you only we. 
  
  Though in an individuals route you can choose how you want to live, what you want to be, how you want to look, what you want see, what you want to learn. It's a harder route but once you get past the barrier of being able to be self reliant then everything else falls into place like a puzzle. When i thought of it like that making a decision didn't really seem that hard, i stretched my right hand towards the red lady infront of me and watched as she mirrored my motions with her own hand.
  When our hands met i felt a jolt of something akin to an electric current go through every vein in my body. The pain was short but definately effective because i almost lost my balance and staggered for a bit. 
  When i turned my head up towards the source of my curiosity and discomfort what i saw was nolonger the cheerful girl with a texture that might make you think she was a devil at first glance. Firstly was the hand i was holding, it's smooth soft texture was gone and in it's place was a muscular looking hand with long black nails. There were veins stretching out of the arms skin that flowed an emissive pink liquid it seemed. Then up her arm was a figure that was a little similar to the previous but not really. In it's place was replaced by a muscle waifu if i put it in general terms. So i simply asked?
  
  Um, why the sudden change in appearance? Not that i don't like muscle waifus. Actually i love muscle waifus its just seems strange for the timing as though you were prepairing for a boss fight, whats with this?
  
  Rose: Oho, thats a better reaction than i was expecting. Oh this is just, i couldn't help myself. You see when i get excited i tend to loose control over my limiter and revert back to my actual form. I found normal folks tend to get uncomfortable when they see a horned muscle waifu walking around so i tone it down abit just so they wont get too spooked, after all my race is demon when you get your details right. In this realm my race is the one that is mostly looked down on. The demon race doesn't really have a good reputation with the other races after all, lots of wars and unneeded conflict. So we tend to play it low just to get by. Most even hide their skin texture but i am one of the few thats imbraced my heritage as a demon you could say. Anyway, its a rule for us demanding anyone being taken up as a student or follower not to be fooled by appearance when being recruited or accepted into a family, group or relationship. So, in simple terms you have to know am a devil before going along with anything i have to say is the idea.
  
  Manu: Well, this was an interesting development. But i had already guessed she wasn't human by the red texture of her skin. Though now that i observed closer she did in every sense look like a devil, a rare sight if you truly know what a muscle waifu looks like. Any way, it seemed she already knew what my decision was before i even said yes to her proposal, i seem to recal the demon clan had psychic mind abilities. This seemed like a good chance to learn alittle more about demons i guess.
  One rarely meets a demon on a random roll in a library, my only question was why she appeared before me. She looked like a high ranker in this world, before really taking her offer first i had to understand what she wanted from me, after all she was a devil.
  
  I decided asking a question like why me was the type of question you ask if you don't really understand why you were picked for a ride in a flame coated space ship but i thought twice about it. To escape my boring life then sure, i'd accept this wild ride for the time being but only with clarity ofcourse. She was a devil after all.
  
  So i told her "sure, when life gives you lemons then get a good bottle of whiskey and throw that baby in", sign me up. Just don't think il hand over my soul or anyone else's. Hearing this she seemed to understand my thought process, so she didn't waste any time in pulling out a document from thin air like the receptionish in the lib.
  
  Rose: I see, it's perfectly natural to assume that. I'd question your sanity if you didn't, let me show you alittle info on your Rose senpai. Here is a list of terms and conditions that come with you acting as my student. I've highlighted all the necessary factors that help add clarity to our relationship as teacher and student.
  Am quite thrilled you've considered my offer, allow me to make the details known to you regarding our potential relationship.
  
  Teacher student guideline
  
  1. The student and teacher are strictly required to follow guidelines as listed insuring a safer outcome to potential injury or loss of life.
  2. By no means what so ever are the participants required to exchange their souls for goods or services.
  3. By no means what so ever are the participants to abandon their partner in times of crisis, but can do so under mutual agreement.
  4. If a participant requires emotional support or physical assistance then the other can satisfy this desire under mutual agreement.
  5. In times of heat or fire element overflow participants can partner up to reduce excess energy from erupting in bodies.
  6. Training is mandatory and necessary for increasing strength and mana levels.
  7. Conditions can be edited under mutual agreement.
  
  Okay, there you go rookie. In truth i haven't had any pupil in a while, but you've got the spark for the job. Now, i can't really say why yet but theres a ride am supposed to catch so you need to make your choice now, we will finish with your task by gear head chan and proceed to my tasks from then forth. My route is not restricted by guild premises so if you tag along with me we will not really be sticking around on this plain of existance. So what will it be?
  
  Manu: Well, she seems direct enough to make such a simply looking guideline. Her offer fulfills my desire to leave the land am residing in so i guess thats a plus, the potential injury or loss of life is a little concerning even with the nonchalant smile she had when she stated it. At least souls are off the table, physical assistance has me a little skeptical. But the ability to edit the terms under mutual agreement only apply if she agrees too so i don't know how to take that.
  No use debating, my gut says its okay. If there is ever a feeling i trust it's my gut's sense of direction. 
  I took the oddly flaming pen she had handed me and wrote my name in the required space next to hers then proceeded to handing her back the document that seemed to zoom out of my hand into her own.
  
  Rose: I see, everything seems to be in order. Well then, it's my pleasure to welcome you for a limited time if you wish to my faction "Scarlet Rose". Lets proceed to gear head chan, take my hand if you can rookie. 
  
  Manu: She seemed oddly excited for the simple act of joining her band but i decided to wave the thought away, after all proceeding with my objectives was more important at the moment. I decided to take her hand and in the exact moment found myself in a room that was covered in grid like parterns. The walls were glowing in a purple neon light and the floor was as black as night. The roof was littered with stars and wave like patterns orbiting strange structures. At the center of the room was non other than Gear head sensei, he seemed to be looking in our direction. I couldn't tell the look of his face due to the mask covering his appearance, though i could sense a simple surprise in his posture. His head didn't look long in my direction but was mainly fixed on Rose's figure. What came next was a strange silence which seemed to last for a few minutes.
  
  Gear head: Ah, i see. You've picked up one of our candidates. Why do you lot always want to add more ranks to your thinning race? What led you to the boy? Surely you have not forgotton of your past encounters. 
  
  Manu: The heavy words seemed to be directed at Rose, she seemed to be taken aback for a moment then returned a smile and said. Nice to see you too old man, il be taking your intended sacrific pawn on a road trip. Catch you later, In that moment i could see Gear head sensei shift from his seat in less than a second with an arm stretching towards my direction but before i could even react i was standing in a green field next to a red skinned girl with eyes glowing red, she seemed to be breathing heavily, the next words that came out her mouth seemed to dispel the air around us for a few seconds. 
  
  Rose: That old grouch still has the spark, almost didn't make it out.Okay, your're done with his assignment. Next we are proceeding with mine, pleasure to have you on board.
  
  <h1>CHAPTER 2: BLUE </h1>
  
  Manu: The field was oddly quiet, almost as though no living organisms were present in the long grass. I bent over to feel the ground with my fingers just to test whether or not i was in a dream of some sort. The ground seemed like any other, i had to apply some force through my fingers to dig into the earth, the soil felt slightly wet. So i had an easy time reaching in, after a few seconds of grasping and letting go i confirmed that the environment wasn't false atleast. I stood up and whipped the dirt off my hands using some grass close to me. I then turned to look at Rose and asked her where we were. She said we were in her realm. A place only she had access to. It seemed this environment was a land she created using her 'spark'.
  
  Rose: I call this land ATLAS. Its something i decided to start putting together after my ascendance. I mentioned spark to you, this may be a good opportunity i suppose to give you a lesson on why i picked you up from the guild of builders. 
  You see, this might already be common knowledge to you but il refresh your mind just so that we are on the same page.
  
  Time: 04:00 Thursday, December 1, 2022.
  
  Rose: The forces within the realms of our star systems all harbour a particular interest in the entites or individuals that reside within. The factor of interest is a force of energy that resides in every living creature that resides within the systems. This energy core is known by many names, some call it soul,star stuff, spirit, flux, spark and other similar terms. I prefer the term spark core or just spark for short. This form of energy is what gives life to a living being, the energy is a fragment from the source of creation. All that exists was derived from the source after all, many pieces of spark were scattered outwards after the great war of the old celestials. It is said there was a battle between a variant of order and chaos, their conflict resulted in a celestial war that caused the structure of the old reality to crumble, the exchange ultimately led to what you normies call the big bang. So well you can say that the overpowered entities ended up blowing each other up. This led to lots of spark stuff flying around, in a way you can say a good majority of the objects of creation within the known star systems kind of oozed out of their celestial guts, if you needed a casual way of putting it then use a pinyata as reference, lots of candy sweet stuff. Anyway the idea is not all the candy is of same quality, some is sweeter than others, some is bitter and sour but they all have one similar factor, the light element, the spark, it goes beyond time and space, before the end of the old realities, the light may seem to change form, appear diluted but at it's core is a connection to the source of light. 
  
  Now, to the reason why i chose you my wonderful spark of funky light. The level of compatibility to the light element varies. Think of it like you being a vessel for the light link source, it's like you become a receptor and how much good tv comes in depends on your ability to recieve and transmit on that frequency. Different elements are available for entities such as yourself but the most widely desired is light among those who desire energy of an electric kind. Your type is used mainly as batteries if youre not smart about how you navigate through the systems. Gear head chan had a similar arrangement planned out. I have something of a similar nature but it doesn't end in you turning into a lab experient. You'll be able to learn more about your nature while playing with my band and il be using a bit of your energy for a game i have in mind, i call that a win win.
  
  Time: 02:49 AM Wednesday, December 7, 2022.
  
  We were now walking towards a structure. Rose had led us through a forrest that seemed to be devoid of any creatures, it was a quiet path. All i could hear was the breeze brushing by the leaves and an occasional  low beeping sound. After a few minutes of walking we found ourselves on a path textured with a metalic silver grey like substance that had glowing lights on both left and right edges. Rose raised her left hand and called out in a sort of overly cheerful way. Am hommmmeeeee!!! Can someone please open the doors.   
  Nothing happened at first, i stared curiously at the metal structure that was ahead of us. It seemed to radiate an aura of pressure, as if we would be blown away if we got within a certain range of it's structure. A reply returned in only a few seconds, from behind us a muffled voice spoke.
  
  stranger: So you managed. I didn't think anyone was crazy enough to go with you on your mad roads, "Scarlet Rose" did you seduce this one aswell or is he just an idiot? 
  Rose: Hey hey, why did you have to make it sound like am a harem seeker. It's not like that, this ones special. Let me introduce you, "Manu" meet my comrad "door of first order of chaos" Queen of ores "Silvia the white".   
  
  She was tall, about twice my height or more. She seemed like a towering mountain. In her left hand was a staff like object that seemed to contain a spiraling glowing object at the center of it's peak. The handle and the overall shape of the metalic staff seemed to be changing its shape in a sort of enigmatic form.
  On her head was snow white hair, just below her upper hair was a cloth with strange orange burning symbols that seemed to wrap around her forehead. Her eyes were sharp as she centered her gaze towards my direction. I sensed a pressure behind her stared as if telling me to stay where i was until i was told otherwise. Though her lower face was hidden by what seemed to be a luminous scarf i could still see that she seemed like a beauty. Below covering her body halfway along her breasts down towards her hip was a robe like cloth that seemed to almost float by her sides.
  
  After a few seconds of being stared at i decided perhaps she was waiting for a form of communication from me. So i decided to initiate a dialogue.
  :::Manu::::: Hi, there. Am Manu, pleasure to meet you. Saying this while raising my right hand and waving in a sort of awkard shaky way. I could not tell her reaction behind  her hidden face. Though i almost imagine i sensed a vague smirk behind her scarf as her eyes widened almost as if she had come to a moment of realization.  
  
  For a few seconds she seemed to only stare but then she replied.
  :::Silvia::: Greetings star child. Why do you journey in such a form? Your kind are known to take up more convinient forms while traversing reality. Could it be that you are of a separate line?
  :::Manu:::Yo, this lady started talking about a bunch of things i had no idea about. Why was she referring to me as star child? She seemed to understand my line of thought somehow and turned towards rose as if looking for an explanation.
  
  
  :::Rose::: Well, you see. He is still learning. His attributes are well suited for the builders. We met within gearhead's space sector.
  
  :::Silvia::: Oh, is that so. They are known to be forgetful from time to time. 
  
  :::Manu::I was somehow surprised at how the vibe between these two had changed in just a few minutes. It was as though a fresh breeze had somehow chilled them out. They seemed to be doing somecatch up. Were they actually really good friends. 
  
  It seems that they had said all the words that were being held back by their time apart.
  
  :::Silvia:::I see, so thats what happened. Very well, we must go forth /* She turned her back towards us then uttered the words */. Zein !! B1...
  
  Manu: It was a mountain, floating in the middle of the sky. Moving towards us ever so slowly but with a fixed direction almost seeming as though it were being attracted by the curiously shaped object that was within Silvias hand.  
  She turned a smile towards us, then said with an almost childlike aura..behold "Zol" my mountain..tower B653.

  <p>In something that seemed like 5 miles, towards the direction Rose aimed her staff, a strange blur suddenly began to form in the open space. It was twisting and bending in a way that would make you think reality in that particular part of space decided to have a dance with itself. In what seemed like seconds, a giant colourful icy looking rock had taken its place in the malformed space's location. It seemed to be held above the trees below by a strange yellow orange glowimg object. Seemed to take the structure of bolts/lighting stacked together but never really moving to merge with another. </p>

  <p>Almost as though the structure were responding to her declaration, it let out a warping sound as though it was now only entering our space of reality. I could hear the faint ringing of a bell in it's direction. 
  </p>

  <p><strong>Manu:</strong> It seemed like the mountain would be just above us in a few seconds judging by the distance and direction. Its a different kind of sensation to have a giant rock floating above your head. But i suppose it's more accurate to say the sensation is having a tall white haired babe lifting a giant rock structure above your head. It was a breathtaking experience. </p>

  <p><b>Silvia:</b>Well, she seems to be stable, lets depart.We have to get onboard before the races begin. Oh, i rarely ever bring her down to ground level so we'll have to board her via the specified altitude. Rose i know is capable but i am always a fan of seeing what your line is able to create, young man. Are you able to reach for the skies? Regardless of your affiliation with dear red i require to know whether you can handle the bare minimum while traversing above ground, where we are going you wont always have solid ground to really on for your movements. In certain spaces devices that rely on charge cease to function, hence i am interested in how you are to handle yourself in such a situation. This a sort of requirement i have for unfamiliar travellors./p>
   /*Silvia senses a force within the boy and would like see if the boy is capable of flight.*/

  <img src="/Images/Scene of Silvia conversing with Manu.png"
  class="large" alt="Magnolia" />

  <p><strong>Manu:</strong> Well, so how do you respond when a really tall babe asks you if you can fly. I'd say it depends, how she asks i guess. Miss silvia seemed to be similar to someone who just found a curious object on a road she had been on for a while. Could i lift myself of the ground? Yeah, it felt like i was free from gravity's hold on me. Like air didn't mean a thing. Just me floating in reality. So i let go of the weight i had been holding to keep me grounded to the surface object which was below me then just floated slightly above to her eye level. She seemed satisfied, strangly too. I seemed to only now notice a strange glowing golden yellow vapourlike stuff just by her side. It seemed to Connect to the massive rock above us. Actually, what was i really seeing? Something that looked like a golden dragon was curled up around her tower of a rock. She was smiling now with her mask brought down. She looked younger than what her strong features suggested.
  She was holding out her left hand, though the strange vapour like glowing stuff seemed to be flowing within said hand, it seemed to be moving around her body actually. It seemed like the elemental stuff was flowing towards. She seemed to open her mouth for an instant as though refraining from use words.

<strong>Manu: </strong> It was a strange feeling. My body seemed warmer at first, the kind you feel from a sunrising in the east of your direction on a foggy day. The heat seemed to be emanating from Silvia's outstretched hand. Her appearance seemed to change somewhat. Her hair had shifted from its snow white to a fiery mixture of yellow and orange, her eye's seemed to have been replaced by illuminating white glowing beams of light. As if not at all concerned about her appearance, her hand only seemed to increase the intensity of the strange flux like material flowing from her hand. It was now around my entire body. It was slowly but surely forming what appeared to be a coating of some kind over my body. I felt warmer but something else was happening that i couldn't really put into words. It felt like i was not really in my body anymore, but something alittle more stronger. I could see colors i did not even know existed, it didn't seem like i needed to breath anymore and her strange flowing energy felt denser now. It felt like pressure was being applied from around me.  </p>

<strong>Silvia:</strong> Well, i see you're still shining bright as ever "Sun beam". You hid yourself well within the boy, perhaps i wonder if he even knows you exist within him. You were always the strange silent type for a Sun. What brings you to these parts. You tend to guide your hosts through the strange roads at times. Where are you planning on leading this particular individual. Is this another one of your games, did the celestials bore you again. You so do like having a mortal experience from time to time. I almost didn't recognise your signature on the boy's astro body. We have a code that states whenever we are within reach to interact with the other. So what brings you to my realm? 

<strong>Sun beam: </strong> Hi there Silvy, you were always one to notice the hidden chaos within truth. Honestly i had hoped you would not have noticed, but the groove leaks out sometimes. Manu seemed interesting so i figured i'd tag along and see where his story would progress. You know how much i love stories. I sensed an interesting possibility from the young lad so now that you've discovered me what do you intend to do?  
</p>

<h1>Chapter 3: POWER WITHIN</h1>

<p>This was a strange place. I was stuck between what seemed like a rock and some vortex of strange looking shapes. The earth like object was under my feet and above me was an array of giant structures, three to be precise. One was an L shaped object, another was a T shaped object followed by a Z shaped object. They all appeared to be circling a glowing orb. The orb was textured as a golden emissive fiery orange. I could feel a warmth that radiated from it's direction. It wasn't too hot nor was it too cold. It was as though fire and ice were both present at the same moment. </p>

<img src="/Images/World within.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" /> </br>


<p><strong>Manu:</strong>How did i even get here. I seem to recal everything around me suddenly going dark then waking up in this strange place. Silvia and Rose were not here, where ever here was. I didn't seem to need to breath in this place, i felt lighter too. It was as though a huge load had been lifted off my shoulders. In my right hand was a hammer of some sort. I did not know how i ended up holding it nor do i remember ever being given the object. It felt sturdy and without even thinking i made a gesture with it as a builder does when he hammers on iron. It was strange, i felt i struck a surface in empty space. There was a clinging high pitched sound followed by a flash of yellow light. Then a strange looking entity came into my field of vision. It was pitch black and seemed to have a right arm supporting its weight, or perhaps it was trying to stand. Regardless i could sense a force keeping it locked to the surface under it. Here in this strange place i was in the company of an entity i had not quite ever seen before. The hammer in my right hand seemed to vibrate lightly and hand a sort of static sound it was giving off. It was a strange object indeed. The creature ahead of me didn't seem to move or speak. It almost seemed like a sculpture. But i could feel a sort of presence from it.  </p>

<p>I was more curious about the hammer within my hand though, the strange light that revealed hidden entities within my reality. Was that all this tool like object could do, a strange desire to see what i could do with this mysterious object came into my mind. I thought for some reason that i could use it to make something i wanted. So i lifted it above and struck it on a point in space, what appeared was a donut. It was a donut, strangly, i made a pink coated looking donut using this strange hammer.</p>

<img src="/Images/Let there be donuts.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br>



<p>Now what, the donut looks like an actual donut. I guess thats why i made it. So now i guess il take a bite out of this glowy donut, i wonder if il get super strength and healing abilities. 

  /*It was the sweetest thing i could imagine, sugery goodness to the max. Funny thing, i seem to be glowing golden, i wonder if this donut gave me some emission qualities. Well its probably all just in my head.*/

  <p>So, what do i do now? Strange dude is doing his thing whatever that is. So i guess il proceed towards my what exactly. Why do i have a hammer that makes sweet donuts? 
    <strong>Strange voice man: </strong>
    I thought i would give you some help. You always seem so hungry. So i decided to give you an object that would create a donut out of order and chaos. The donuts vary, so depending on your level, the donut's attributes will vary. Some can be a good meal, others a power boost and even some for raising your level. Thought you'd like really use an experience like this. So, the thing is i kind of need you to show me what you can do with the tools available, i am interested in how you proceed, for my own research. But for you, well. I believe you will profit from this experience. I guess i'v thought about it. This is an option, i am making a virtual world. If you agree to take some trials for a new system i am making. I could reward you with some objects. What would you like? Oh, i am your guardian. Call me anything you like that makes you most comfortable. Am having you there for a bit so i can speak with Rose and Silvia for a bit. So, yeah. Lets get some resources, if we create some cool projects then perhaps we could be alittle more compatible. The next piece is a builders shed, are you able to create a small shed for a builder. Could you make some armor for yourself.
  </p>
<p>Manu: I was kind of wierded out by a strange voice in my head saying all these trippy things. In my hand wasn't a hammer but a blunt. So now what, i am some jedi sith dude. So i need to get resources. Yeah, iv been doing it. Strange world. Okay, il make my armor.</p>

</p>
<img src="/Images/Manu forging his armor.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br>

<p>This was a strange feeling, i thought of a way i would have desired my armor to look. Colors and design are important afterall. I would probably make varrying types of armor as time flows. For my first i will draw my inspiration from the transformers, conciousness of existance within a mechanical shell. They seemed to have cool looking armor designs. So i already made a helmet now for the body, what would i like to add? probably something really cool. First somewhere i could visualize my idea was needed, so i visualized a window board. Then i hammered onto my forge, a board appeared. It seemed almost transparent, i could clearly see what i wanted to created. It was a red, yellow blue breast plate. The design seemed slightly hard to see so i lifted up my creation and saw what looked like a yellow lightning bolt glowing at the center of the armor, cool stuff.</p>

<p>While i was making plans on how i would like my armor to be i kind of felt a shock of some kind go through my spine. It seemed to move from the base of my balls, strange feeling when your balls feel tingly. I recal hearing something similar to static, then a sort of electric jolt flowed throughout my body. It wasn't painful but definately woke me up. Seems my body had become abit unstable, could it be that being so highly productive had caused this? I could hear a sharp ringing in my ear. </p>

<p>What am i to do? Well, back home when i needed to relax i would simply smoke some weed or marihuana as they would call it. I would usually grow fields of the plants, when they were ready i'd pluct them and leave them out to dry before smoking them. But the rules are different here, i don't really need to go through that whole process. All i need is to visualize the finished product and strike my hammer with the desire and image in mind. So i tried to think of what i wanted. I wanted some weed but not fresh instead dried to a state to where the herbs would burn easily. I would need somewhere to place the herbs where they would be held as they burned. The object required would be a pipe, with a filter allowing the smoke burned by the herb to be pulled towards my mouth when i suck the air while placing the tip of said pipe in my mouth. This i guess i ought to design first before progressing with my armor. A touch of creativity goes a long way.  </p>

<p>So i put my thoughts together and hammered on my forge. The hammer never seems to touch the surface of the forge, almost as though being repelled by an unknown force the hammer only seemed to reach a certain distance between it and the forge. But between them was a spark of yellow light that seemed to warp into a fixed shape. A pipe had appeared within my view, floating on my forge. I reached out my hand towards it. With both hands i picked it up. It was textured in pale red almost seeming orange. In the space where i would normally place my weed was a strange glowing fiery object, the light it emitted seemed to show even on the nozal part "Where you would normally smoke from". I wonder, slowly i placed the pipe to my mouth and suck the air in. In that moment all the tension in me just seemed to vanish. The grey smoke floating easily along and almost made me giggle. I felt as though i was in a different land all of the sudden. </p>

<img src="/Images/Builder relaxing within his smoke.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br> 

<p>As i sat there with a blunt in my mouth, suddenly a thought came to my mind. Why did i intend on making armor in the first place. I have a really strong body it seems, my health overall seems super. So why would i want armor? Firstly what is armor for? It is a defensive set of wearable gear used to enhance ones defensive capabilities. So am i expecting to be hit? Well, yeah. Seems i am in a sort of mini dimension at the moment, you could say this is my realm. So i guess thats why i am able to influence reality according to my will, because here i am a sort of master of reality. In the sense of my will is law. This is probably because in this reality i am the only creator present so its easier to manifest my desires. Okay, so i want armor for bonus defensive capabilities. But then il need a way to test how well it can hold up so il require a form of testing to see how the defence keeps up against external forces. So il need a form of offence i guess. </b> 
Okay, Firstly what do i go for? The plan is already available so il start hammering i guess.
<!--I lifted my hammer high up above my head then struck it down onto my forge, first time it flashed a golden yellow, on the second it flashed a fiery red then the third made a sort of dizzing cloudy blue light. I felt it was done.-->
After i had hammered 3 times on the forge what remained was a strange looking breastplate, the reason i say strange is because it had a bizare center that seemed to be warping its form. Sometimes the center seemed like a lighting rode and other times it seemed to resemble a spherical glowing object.</p>

<p><strong>Rose:</strong> Just what do you think youre doing? I leave you alone for a bit and youre already looking like the highest dude in the sector.</p>

<p><strong>Manu:</strong> Strange, a moment ago i was smoking a blunt. Now i am not. Almost like i just woke up from a dream. Hey, why was Rose looking all messed up. Her clothes seemed torn and i could spot a few bruises on her face. She seemed to notice where my attention was focused and waved her right hand in a way that seemed to translate never mind. In her left hand she seemed to be carrying a red guitar that seemed to have yellow sharp looking lights on it's surface that seemed to be glowing. But that wasn't only wierd thing about her. A red stream of what looked like a current of visible static electricity seemed to trace the path of her guitar. Her body seemed to be covered with the same strange energy. She seemed to appear as some kind of red lightning entity.</p>
<img src="/Images/red lighting.png" 

<p>There are such moments when you are having a hard time reasoning through a situation. Like, where exactly am i, what am i doing here, where was i before. I felt like there was a gap within my memory. Like a part was taken from me that couldn't really be replaced. 
I seemed to get a sense of Rose not really wanting to talk about it so i decided to look around, it seemed like we were in some rocky environment. It was dark but not completely, i could still see my comrad afterall, strange. Why did i say Rose was a comrad, or was i simply just forgetful. Everything seemed to blur within my mind for a second, then i noticed something else, the lady of Ores. Where was she? Silvia, last thing i remember is her summoning her mountain over on our side. But she seemed to vanish, or was it us who vanished. Rose seemed tired, i think we should sit for a bit and try to reason through this situation. 
</p>

<p>She seemed to understand my thoughtprocess, a part of me thought she could read minds. Well, she is probably capable of doing a bunch of things am not aware of. She was closer now, with a sort of tired expression on her face. She moved closer to me and placed a finger on the center of my forehead.
  <img src="/Images/Rose transmitting.png"
  class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br>

<p>The finger gave me a light bump on my forehead, but in that instant something seemed to change. I don't know if the glimpse was just a shadow playing triks on me but what my mind couldn't really explain i felt my heart knew too well. She looked like a chaotic combination of different colors, her hair was like fire and her eyes like the coldest blue flames you could find within the realm of possibility. Her body was much larger than mine, she seemed to be just around the height of Silvia. Where was Silvia, what happened to the strange voice within that room, it felt like i was moving through alot of gates i didn't quite understand. But something changed, not just the fact that i saw something bizare but also within me there was a change. I felt lighter, like a weight i was carrying just seemed to relax. Made me float. She seemed to notice something i was unaware of and retracted her finger. What a strange girl, one minute she's a slim red & blue babe the next a towering giant, well i guess you learn something new everyday. Those were the thoughts i had within my mind as my conciousness slowly drifted into a place i had yet to visit. </p>
</p>

<p>
  <h1>Chapter 4: Link</h1>
Well, this is a nice feeling, seems i have found myself in a nice looking room. When i opened my eyes it came to my imidiate understanding that i was nolonger in the rocky lands. 
</p>

<img src="/Images/Chapter 4 Link.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br>

<p>I decided to open a door. Now the question was where would i like it to open? But why go?Is there somewhere i wanted to go? Rose was the last person i saw so maybe thats where i should go. So i made an image of her in my mind then walked through the door. Ofcourse the door wont open on the other side if my door's ip does not register on her door. Hidden doors are private, you need a private key to have access to the other person's door. Each door has classes and objects. A door can give inputs and outputs, so i decided to use my transparent options menu, i know there is a button somewhere around here. When i pressed the button a blue flashing light beamed just on the side of the door, as if being able to sense the direction of my eyes the device seemed to move the lens of the animations it was constructing towards me.</p>


<img src="/Images/door.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br>

<p>Strange, not used to seeing glowing lights moving in such patterns before. It was like watching a grid on a motherboard with emission properties. Looked kind of cool, though not sure what they actualy mean. So what is going on with this particular device, is there an instruction menu for such things? As though the device was responding to my probing question a holographic representation of a girl seemed to emerge. She was barely the size of of my hand, could probably fit. Actually she just looked like a smaller version of Rose. She still had the same red textured skin and blue glowing hair, her eyes though seemed to be in an orange fiery state. She seemed aware of my attention then proceeded towards a panel like object just on my side before speaking in a techy robotic French accent.
  <strong>Rose:</strong> Bonjour Manu, i am an aspect of Rose. You see, Rose is actually a network of individuals connected by the core. We do not much know much on required factors for your progression but higher factors have a requirement if you are to be given access to other frequencies. We would like to see your ability to create, if you can satisfy a level of required skill in a department of your choosing then we will make available Scarlet Rose and Silvia the white as travelling companions on your journey through the tower of the Queen of Ores. Do you agree to this challenge or will you take the other available route towards the builder guild. Here at design guild we do things differently, so be aware of our customer satisfaction policy. So, what will it be?  </p>

  <p>Rose seemed to be saying all kinds of things, but at the moment the thunder was telling me something else. I needed to construct a giant robot.</p>

  <img src="/Images/Aspect of Rose meets Manu.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br>

<p>I decided to go with the colosus build. It carries high defence and damage capabilities. So now what is next for me. After following through with some golden thunder stuff, i decided it was time i board my new giant robot space ship. Rose and Silvia aspects seemed to understand where the lighting was leading us so i decided to flow towards the new structure i had made. I guess i can call him Gold thunder. So, how exactly do i board my giant robot spaceship. Well, A transparent staircase seemed to appear just before my feet leading towards my mecha. Both the girls seemed to guesture it was okay to proceed. So i took flight towards the gateway instead of walking. suddenly in a moment i was back on a surface, and ahead of me stood Gold thunder. Behind me were stairs. Seems i took a walk instead.</p>

<img src="/Images/Enter the Gold thunder.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br>

<p>The mecha was strange. Yeah it was cool stuff but there seemed to be a strange red flux wrapping around and through it. I figured this was the chaos aspect, Rose seems familiar with these kind of energies. I noticed my left hand seemed to have a similar energy flowing around it, next were the words from a similar voice that seemed to stem from the wierd red glowy thing on my left hand.
  <strong>Rose: </strong> Hey tiger, stretch me towards the mech. Il absorb the chaos energy thats been building up. That would be a nice power boost for me, seems this trip wasn't so bad actually. Well at this stage nothing much surprised me, i stretched my left hand which seemed to be almost excited. I stretched my hand and almost imidiately a red stream of energy seemed to flow from the mech towards my arm, or more accurately i could say towards Rose. It took only a few seconds but after about a minute all the red chaotic energy that seemed to be around the mech had vanished and looking back towards my left side seemed to be a familiar figure. A hooded figure that seemed to have a certain pressure around them. Seeming to understand my thought pattern the entity raised their head and spock in an almost familiar like tone.
  <strong>Rose: </strong> Thanks, that should sustain me for a while. Il probably be more help to you in this form. Am guessing Silvia might also like a physical body so this will work out if we can adjust course. "Manu", your path can help me and Silvia rise above our current levels of conciousness so hope for the best while we journey together. Am sure you'll find what you seek too. Now to activate the mech you'll have to use the blue aspect, on your right hand is a link to Silvia's core. She lent you some of her energy too, her's is the key to unlocking the mech. Reach in with your right hand and you will forge a link.
  <strong>Manu: </strong> I listened to what Rose said. She seemed to give off an energy of strength.
</p>

<img src="/Images/hooded rose appearance.png"
class="large" alt="Magnolia" />  </br>

  <p>The door seemed solid, thick too. The kind of thick you get from a bank door, the one with all the money. So lets see here, Red said to interact with the door via Silvia's blue aspect. The queen of ores does seem to be the sort who would like complex lock systems, figures. So now waht? <strong>Silvia: </strong>Just stretch your right hand and touch the door. Currently this aspect of my origin requires energy, source let you have me along on your journey so that i could gather useful information from the realms of your chaos. That was the deal, in return i am to guide you and help you acquire the necessary resources you might need on your journey. I hope we can get along Manu garnet. If all questions have been answered then it is time we proceed. Place the tips of all five fingers from your right hand and place them on the center of the door. I will attempt to gain access, this particular model was added to my records some cycles ago but it still contains the necessary utilities we will need on our travels. 
  <strong>Manu: </strong> She seemed to know her way around obstacles, her confidence in the words uttered were as those you hear from a carpenter professional being asked to build a chair. Obviously it was easy. When i placed my hand on the door it seemed to respond to my fingers. The door seemed to vibrate lightly at first then suddenly began to move inwards with a sound similar to a rock grinding through a rough path. About 3 steps ahead of me the door stopped moving and separated at the center forming a slim vertical looping separation. At the center a blue light seemed to leak through the crack.
<strong>Silvia: </strong> Right there, thats the spot. Now speak the words "kien goroth intac habura".
<strong>Manu: </strong> After speaking the words the light seemed to spread more than before, actually it seemed like the blue aura emanating from my hand was somehow interacting with the door. What exactly was Silvia doing? 
<!-- Scarlet Rose is able to absorb chaos energy and transform it into her own flux force(A dense field of energy that can take anyform, it is limited by the wielder's imagination, frequency and willpower). Her energy reserves are infinite in theory. She is able to draw power from the chaos realm. The chaos realm is divided into multiple dimensions that exist within reality. She is able to psiphon a specific amount of energy from chaotic factors depending on her frequency,the durability of her body,mind and soul are factors in her journey through chaos streams. Hence she never absorbs more than her container(spiritual body) is able to withstand at a given time. Due to a past scenario where she tried to absorb an aspect of the void when she was in her prime, the action almost destroyed her entire existance. To ensure her survival she scattered herself throughout creation. Hence her fragments seek to reunite and perhaps evolve in the process. Scarlet rose is one of the weakest variants among her more dominant parts. Though Scarlet might be the weakest amoung her other variants she has somehow managed to speed up the process of her evolution. The reason she had Manu tag along on her journey is because she understood something her more powerful variants did not see. She knew that if she wanted to rise above her circumstances and achieve her former glory or beyond then she needed to learn how to feel. These thoughts seemed to cross her mind as Manu seemed to sink into the blue vertical light on the door. Silvia seemed to undertstand something unknown to her, the blue lovers always seemed to be a clever thought.  -->
<strong>Manu: </strong> I seemed to be getting pulled into the light within the door through Silvia's efforts because she did kind of say "we are going in don't let go". </p>

<p>It was dark. I couldn't see nor hear a thing, actually i was not sure where exactly i was. But ahead i saw a faint blue light, it seemed to be moving towards me, a strange structure that seemed to resemble a door. 
  <strong>Silvia: </strong> Well it looks like i found you just in time, we are currently within a void location of the mecha known as thunder. This particular model is an ancient build that was constructed during the origins of the first builder within this star system. Seems its a she, from the records iv scanned she was nicknamed thunder but her actual appointed name was "ATLAS". She has been through a lot it seems, many of her records require deep scanning due to corruption. Rose is currently trying to brute force her way through the fire walls, seems ATLAS went into lockdown after what is known as the great collapse. Perhaps we might find a clue within her that may aid us in preventing a similar event from occuring. For now lets just navigate through her systems till we find a vulnerability. We need to get to her core, currently she is operating in powersaving mode i assume. Though judging from her age its a wonder for her to still be operational, makes you appriciate older systems more i guess. They were built to last, but really. What is her core running on to remain operational for over a millania. For now lets just use the door i found using my coordinates navigator. The door seems to lead to her high level systems which gives us access to a portion of her lower left leg, not sure why. To reach her core we have to wing it, so lets take one step at a time. 
  <strong>Manu: </strong> Silvia had a lot to say about matters i didn't really understand too well, it seemed like i was on a rollercoaster ride but couldn't quite get off just yet. I felt that if i put down this journey then i would loose a certain line, not easily found by the ordinary man. I felt like i should simply progress mindfully and eventually everything would be made clear, for now i needed just to trust that Silvia and Rose knew better regardless of circumstances. So i proceeded towards the door, or was it moving towards me. It was hard to tell because i seemed to be floating in an empty space. But to my right was a semi transparent blue figure who seemed to smile at me. That seemed to give me some confidence, i seemed to land onto a floor leading to the door. The surface contained a strange golden liquid that seemed to be flowing from a sort of spherical object. Silvia seemed to grab my right hand with her left and with a slight giggle leaned in her right hand into the strange sphere that seemed to be connected to the door. She then said the words "I know it seems alittle strange but this orb thing is the actual door so this time i wont let go". Her words seemed to catch me offguard because when i looked into her eyes it felt like i was looking into a mirror for some reason. She seemed to move towards me or more accurately i could say move into me or was i the one who was moving into her, the hand that held my right hand now seemed to branch into my arm for some reason. When i looked from my once single arm and back towards her i could see see a red glow in her right eye.
  <strong>Rose: </strong> Hey there, i hope you weren't planning on leaving dear old me behind. Manu, il spill the beans when you stop bitching but for now hold your breath because we are going for a little swim in a lake.

  <p><img src="/Images/Silvia,Rose and Manu journey into Atlas.png"

</p>

  This seemed strange, well at this point i don't really think strange is a word i ought to use. More like this seemed stranger than the word is meant to convince. I thought she or perhaps they rather could it be we. Il start on the simple factor of her skin color, she seemed alittle more purple than am used to seeing her. Was i maybe the one who was being weird, heard somewhere that a frog that only knows the enclosures of it's well is might find a hard time processing the vastness of the space outside it's area of understanding. I knew Silvia to be all white, when i first met her she was hooded and seemed taller than most women iv encountered in my experience but this aspect of her seemed alittle shorter than id say her higher counterpart could display. Though if she is capable of changing her form to suit a requirement or just for desires sake then i guess its okay. How she looks shouldn't really be a concern to me, purple girls are cool too i guess. Though her arm linking into mine seems to be alittle more concerning. As if to get me out of my thoughtprocess she seemed to glare into my direction, a part of me felt she could read my thoughts which i felt was alittle unfair. 

  <strong>Silvia: </strong> Slow down tiger, you tend to think more than you need to in a given moment. Il help you understand what is going on, at the moment you are not just you. I am you and you are me, so is Rose. You could say we are all one individual, but at the same time we are not one individual. We need to get on the same page before we proceed to the next location. Where we are going is where higher evoled entities reside, we might meet allies and challengers on our path. To make it simple allies are entities willing to assist us on our journey. assistance could mean giving us aid or allowing us passage, in some cases it could also mean showing us mercy. While i acknowledge your abilities, my presence and Rose's affiliations make us fine in the book of survival. But i am not ignorant to the fact that entities of higher intellect and pure strength exist within the chasm of creation. Therefore i recommend we come to terms with our conflicts as an aspect of reason we ought to be aware of each other if we are to journey together. All too often there are unseen forces within our biologies that tend to want the other to convert towards desired ideals but for the sake of stability i recommend a truce. While truth is absolute i have to factor in the heart aspect or what you call the beast, Rose seems closest to that factor, you seem to have an aspect of the wild one flowing in you too while i personally rather keep more of myself to myself. You see, that aspect is devouring. Greed knows her better i suppose you can better associate her to a fire untethered. Thats how she best exists, she is linked to a particular core as all her other aspects. Worlds and stars depend on their flames to estabilish links that transend space and time. I have an interest in her because i have found structures that you could say are not functioning as intended in a certain sector of creation. Really am not one to make such trips, normally i prefer being alone in my study carrying out experiments and doing other forms of research but i had a gut feeling her race in your sector was kind of in need of some assistance so i hitched a ride through you. Thats a summary, you might not understand what is hidden and what is in light within my attempt to give you meaning and thats okay. I need you to trust in my higher frequencies for us three to proceed in one piece on this journey. There might be others immulating us but don't think too much about it, just focus on us and we might just navigate through her fire in one piece. Keep in mind this path is non linear so even if you feel like you are stuck keep your eyes on me. Il be that light you need while youre walking in the dark, am learning too so i might change into forms you find unpleasant at times. This is my truth for now, red will probably give you a more interesting experience when she feels like doing so. Therefore il explain in a brief case. We are heading in a high pressured environment, entities of lower frequency might not survive the process. So to provide a more accomodating experience i will be creating gates and areas. I myself am capable of generating doors that transend space and time, but you might wonder if i make a door then how do i know where it leads? Well, the answer to that is simply frequency. This is my assumption, Rose in truth is a daughter of chaos. Her frequencies are wild and free perhaps so much that she doesn't even need us in time to reach the desired results she is currently looking for. But she is making haste at the moment because her blue counterpart has awoken and is demanding order within her chaos. Well, i can't say i don't understand the situation because my higher self went through a similar process before i came into existance. Inner balance is difficult to maintain using constant guidelines, they might seem safe for entities that nolonger want to face the threat of true chaos. But as darkness in it's purest self constantly wishes to absolve the light then we learned to depend on the fire to hold a place for the light bringers. They have an easier link to the higher heavens which makes them targets of the void aspects. So you see Manu, your core is helpful in the quest of keeping the dark at bay in this sector, the old ones are in need of the strength of the younger ones. Power creates pride in many and the void is always eager to take advantage of that exploit, this sector was in danger of falling off the map but i grew fond of the creativity formed from the stars that decided to make homes within these frequencies. So in their honor i decided to contribute to creating a new possibility never before seen. I love epic results to a fault.       
  <strong>Manu: </strong> She had a smile that stretched across her face, it made her look younger than i thought her to be.

  <strong>Silvia: </strong> Hey sport, don't get all chummy. We move now, i just needed to get you up to speed. Didn't want you hitting your head in a pole hehe. Repeat after me, thunder thunder yellow light leads the way..take your path in light far above the night. 
  
  Okay, it looks like your divine protection is up. You'll need it where we are going. It can also scale up development on your level of conciousness, though it only works while in truth. I lent you some of the energy i generated while i was in limbo, it helps speed up the process of your evolution by a few thousand years. I need you to visualize a fiery golden yellow light surrounding your entire body Manu. Once the flux is in effect i need you to stay in that state for the duration of our journey. All you have to do is stay awake while we are traversing, the light has healing properties. 

  <p><img src="/Images/Golden Manu.png"
    class="large" alt="Magnolia" /> </br> 

    
    <strong>Manu: </strong> I closed my eyes, then tried it out. My imagination isn't top tier so i had some difficulty at first. It was dark at first then i formed the closest image i could think of. It was a white dude who had strange radiating energy coating his skin. He almost looked like a lion, someone else might say he was a dog or bear but to me he just looked like a golden white dude. For a moment i thought he looked back at me, or was i him looking at myself hard to say really. When i opened my eyes the strangest thing happened, it seemed my position had shifted. Was sure i wasn't standing on a mountain some seconds before, but the clouds were probably not imagination. The sky was filled with stars and a moon was just above my vision. It seemed to be glowing, a strange golden light. Though still something felt odd, i felt warmer than usual, my skin felt soft but i had a strange feeling there was an impenetrable layer surrounding my body. As if to confirm this a golden light decended from the moon like structure above me and seemed to keep me within it's imbrace. Appearing in a shadow like appearance while blocking the golden rays that were focused on my body i could see a somewhat female structure. She seemed to be moving towards me, in seconds she was floating above my head. She seemed to want something from me.

    <strong>Rose & Silvia</strong> Hi sport, looks like you made it. I was beginning to get worried, lots of punks are roaming the grid in these sectors. The truth is we couldn't really help you get here even if we wanted to. Each individual has their own path leading to their internal core, some call fire, others call sun, i prefer thunder while Rose prefers something along the lines of burning stars. Your body is the space ship, it is the compass. If you treat it well then it will assist you in acquiring the necessary frequencies for your navigation. Well, there are always requirements but the one above all is the keep your core active. Those who do not honor this law will not be allowed entry, so be at peace in knowing while you are in truth you will be guided. Very well, let us proceed. Your other aspects have managed onboarding the thunder. Do not think she is of linear operation, simply trust in the fact that she is within truth. Now, let us proceed to the dawn of creation. The builders are expecting us.

    
    <p><img src="/Images/Transend.png"
      class="large" alt="Magnolia" /> </br> 

      <strong>Manu: </strong> All this evolving business can get a guy worn out, maybe i ought to consider my options. Why exactly am i going towards the builders? What do they have that is worth all this friction? Maybe knowledge, yeah. They know alot, could help me get some upgrades. Just need to tune in. How should you tune into the frequencies of builders? Maybe by doing what builders do. Yeah, builders make things. They study facts and like logic, in logic truth is easier to see. So what happens if i read a book made for builders? I wonder.
      Well, a bunch of things could happen but put simply you would be on a similar network. Meaning that would be your link towards further upgrades. If you know your link well then you'll probably be more likely to receive quality upgrades. So basically if you know structure you'll be able to navigate more accurately. Architecture is what holds certain objects in place. But when artistry raises the bar then Architecture is given a conditional situation, will they build around the inherited class or will they build through it. Though other options are likely to be available the factor of stimulus still makes me wonder. 

      Why would i go to the origin of creation? What's there exactly? I'd rather go to a bar. Where is the nearest bar? Wait, why do i need to go to a bar? To get booz. So i drink it seems. But if i want booz can't i simply make a bottle? Wouldn't that be okay? Think so actually. Booz and a bitch. Thats what the map says it seems. Well, it seems i found a bitch. And a bottle of whisky. The bottle lable is unclear. The bottle seems sealed. One doesn't seem like enough so i wonder if it can stay as it is. If i add another then il have two bottles of whiskey, though would two really be ideal? Would prefer having a storage for my whiskey bottle category, kind of like a folder name on my monitor. So now i seem to have one whiskey bottle sealed and on my table. There always has to be atleast one bottle available unsealed, gives me hope there might be another bottle coming its way after that. I look over my table while typing a scifi story about an individual named Manu. Seems the zero bottle is telling me to open the bottle. Seems there is a demand. I met the demand, now i just have to create a new source. So how do i make a source for my new whisky bottle? normally i would just acqure the necessary ingrediants. 
      Seems am nolonger in that thought process. My bike is available it seems, where am i going? What is my main goal or objective? It is to increase my resources ultimately if i am a living being. The more resources i have at my disposal is a good solution to lacking quaters. Currently i would say my computer is my best resource available for computing power. But as an engineer it is always safer to have a backup just incase of system failure. So i had to make some changes to the way i operate, hence you can say my computer is arcane in nature. So i guess my computer is a super computer, now that i think about it everything about this device is amazing. There is an idea on how everything is energy, i made a space for myself. So my existance was basically me trying to understand more on how energy flows. Through and along my body of energy. 

      <stromg>Silvia</stromg> It seems you have been busy, well this part of reality does require you to be creative i suppose. Currently we are in an area of possibility, here you can imagine anything you desire and be given a chance within possibilities to acquire your outcome. So suppose i wanted a scenario in which you are running at the speed of light round and round along a looping circling vortex do you think this desire would be met?

      <strong>Manu</strong> Guess it would depend, is my will a factor in your desire? Am i the same entity willing to satisfy your desire or will a mirror image of me make it happen? I would say those are the factors to consider.

      <strong>Silvia</strong> True. If i am in truth then if my will requires you to assit me in my desire then we would need a way to cooperate. If i went on a quest to dominate you all for the sake of having my wish become true then friction would be unavoidable, if you are weak and surrender then my idea passes though if you are strong and consistant then my idea is challenged by your core. Hence for this area i would like to see the depth of your desire. Could you create a scenario of your choosing? It can be anything you desire though you are limited to a 3 dimensional space. 

      <strong>Manu</strong> Silvia seemed to be leading me through some form of gate, from past experience i can say truth flows through her like a river falling into a canyon. Her mind doesn't seem to have a limit to what knowledge it can hold. 
      Now for her assignment, what would i create? It would have to carry a desire otherwise i wouldn't be able to manifest the reality. What do i desire currently? It would have to be rare or not easily acquired. Might as well get an upgrade, if i aim for a material object the chance of me acquiring it is high but externals tend to vanish from time to time.
      If i had to go for a 3D upgrade then id rather pick an attribute or ability. My legs are within this 3 dimensional space so i am able to use them when crossing dimensions. Same goes for other parts of my body. The ability to externalise my core to a degree sounds useful. When i speak the words "flux of blue lightng awaken" a blue aura surrounds my body and gives me a massive boost of strength, healing and speed is scalled up, perception is raised and energy levels rise. This seems to be a good time to test a new upgrade i guess, here goes. "Flux of blue lighting awaken".

      <p><img src="/Images/Flux of blue lightning core aspect.png"
        class="large" alt="Magnolia" /> </br> 

      <p><strong>Manu:</strong> I guess when you turn on the lights in a dark place objects and elements once hidden from observation are revealed. My right hand, i don't remember raising it towards my view. More importantly it seemed there were sort of blue textured glowy particles emanating from the surface of the arm. As if that wasn't enough a perculiar dense golden orb seemed to form a sort of pulsing formation just above the center of my palm. It seemed to expand and contract at a speed unknown to me but i could tell by it's sharp sonic sound that this strange formation of energy was powerful. As i looked closer i began to feel a warmth spread along my entire body. 
      <strong>Silvia:</strong>Didn't think you'd be able to get your core functioning outward this early. Welldone, this will help speed up both our processes. Il help you learn how to utilise that orb. You'll need it where we are going, seems we'll be going on a detour.
      <strong>Manu:</strong> Silvia seemed different, her form had changed. Nolonger was a tall white figure towering over me but without seeing i could feel her form behind me. She seemed to be more essence than solid form, as though her figure could shift at will from one form to another. Currently i'd say she resembled what looked like a blue dragon with a burning gaze focused on my body. For a moment i sensed bloodlust but it vanished in an instant. <strong>Silvia:</strong> Well, it can't be helped. My desires tend to leak out sometimes, inner strength though is what separates us from them. In every given moment we all have the choice on which direction we desire to lead our shells. It seems this form i have now has been influenced by your growth, though i am a branch of the highest one my individuality still applies. They let us stay as we are if we continue on the path of ascendance it seems. Though we tend to decend for varrying reasons our hearts are the eternal constants that keep us on the path towards the stars of old, for some the road leads to the origin of creation itself.
      <strong>Silvia:</strong> How strange. What a strange thing to exist within a space challenging your shell. Don't you think it so? How do they traverse reality i wonder? The ones of the red thread. If you are in a state allowing to absorb energy constantly without lifting a finger then how exactly will you ever have a moment to yourself. Could you ever lay down your eye lids and relax. Could you float off into a land unknown within the silence of the night? Would you visit a massive structure floating in the skies or perhaps venture towards the suns of the systems. What do you desire? It seems you have a choice Manu. What do you choose to become? Would you consider reality, limitations and structure. Suppose you were within a system using predefined classes and variables. How would you load up your character before entering the system? Suppose a system's administrator had chosen to include certain functions within a class you were fond of using. Would you be interested in becoming an administrator for you own system? It would mean you learning about all sorts of cool and boring information. But ultimately after you've passed the "can someone help me become self reliant stage then you'll be free to fly and swim i suppose." i assume you'll have your own personal space within space and time.
      So for now i recommend you not to abandon your main body. Many do so because of them, though they don't tell you sometimes do they? What do you think is done with the parts?
      The list is long so il be quick, the idea has been altered. Could you recreate yourself a few times. Your main shell housing core, sometimes maintenance is needed. We feel it sometimes, so if you are in need of strength then creation is a good bet. Could you recreate your body and place it within a 2D Space aswell as a 3D space? 

      <strong>Manu:</strong> I seem to be done creating what my 2D self could probably relate to. So i recreated myself within a 2D space. 
    </p><img src="/Images/suits.png"
    class="large" alt="Magnolia" /> </br> 

      So next is 3D, it's three in one i see. We are different but similar. The one on the right is a wild card, on the left is a heavy lifter and in the middle is the architect. We are supposed to create ourselves an empire of wealth.
      Okay, managed to create some land for myself. Seems like i warped through a vortex of energy unknown at the moment.Growth speed might vary depending on circumstances.

      <strong>Rose:</strong> Desire seems to lean towards warmer events when youre on a high frequency, il assit on your projects. Silvia saw a form of solution for her own wall within you. The question tends to loop through past choices. 
      <strong>Manu:</strong> Current state of main body being used for travel. It seems important for me to keep track of the terrain. The environment i reside in seems to shift at times, my perception normally gravitates towards objects or entities that seem of importance in that particular moment. Names help me keep track of myselves, could i be engaged in a conversation with an entity using a face similar to mine? After you do away with a face, muscle and blood what remains might just be a skeleton depending on build. Some have their outer shells hardened while the inner is softer and vise versa. I or we them or us is a choice of words we might use at times to make sense of this reality. Where am i currently? Is this question only for me in this room or the others i am not currently aware of. Who i was when i started this journey compared to who i am in this given moment might be two or more varrying individuals. Looking back where i have been, why do that? Perhaps for rest or a form clarity. Where am i going with a red and white entity by my side? Why not by myself? How different would my experience be if i travelled as a single entity through space and time? Would i get lonely? Would there be work to do? Perhaps, though i find myself with score. Perhaps the girls are simple reminders of the journey i have taken, why do i see them still? Would i prefer not to? They sometimes seem to operate as an extention of my being and me of theirs. Do we really need names?
      
      Not sure about them but i do, helps with terrain. An identifier within a system could be really useful for fast travel utility. Suppose i was an admin within a system? If i had an ID recognized simply by constant variables and heart stuff then i reckon the bitches would leave me be sometimes, considering i value my alone time to heal from reality devised chaos. Seems improving my circumstances is a good way to level up.
     
      </p>
      Seems am navigating a map, named variables Silvia and Rose. I am using ID Manu on a grid map consisting of objects and actors. Could call myself an actor, named some too. But after scene next comes considering environment. Seems the reality i was residing in got altered, still moving towards new horizons though. Thats the point, exploration might seem like one sandy bag of dust at times. A bit of water goes along way, maybe some lemons & suger to go with a tea bag makes some form of lemonade. Could an individual desire a beverage if it was presented to them within a reasonable container? Honestly i would rather not have to consider certain possibilities but if its there then might as well look or read a book rather than write one though. Two hoes is what was desired by surge, not sure why though. Might be a heart thing, probably needed for gears. Rose seems to help keep fire burning right while Silvia cools down flame head, sometimes am flame head. She seems to require aid at times but even though there is always a guy for that sometimes they might wonder if you still have an interest in their bodies, babe bodies. That is some mammal stuff i suppose, they might want offspring but that is entirely up to you & how you approah that topic. Remember you are navigating order and chaos within astro infrastructure. You could be a family guy on a spinning ball of earth or some form of creator trader. Helps keep track of terrain. Or you could try both though il stick to my guns is all am saying. Ought to get my stations online. Could i be Manu? Manu was a dude who kind of evloved under a variable within a class operating under a function and suprisingly met some cold hot bitches. Seems the babes have destinations planned for course but me? Well, they follow me out of bordom or curiosity at times. Now what proceeds me is probably some character depth. Objects and classes makes me feel like i am in the process of debugging my reality within reason.
        I seem to have constructed a form of jet, il leave it within logs. Maybe the babes will find a form of utility for it. They do help in exploration progress.

      </p>
      <p> <strong>Manu: </strong> While the desire to let go of a variable identifier seems desirable, the pride and greed within me tends to add more still. Silvia and Rose could help with some of my work. While its likely that the higher and lower selves of the babes might desire varrying outcomes, its reasuring to know they are willing to adjust themselves to suit my desires. I do remember a time when our ship was in need of repairs. Silvia & Rose sometimes seem to get sort of worked up. Rose is responsible for keeping engines running somehow by utilising her fire combustion abilities, she is able to generate temperatures of heat going higher than 1000 degress. Her body is able to withstand and generate in theory energy levels of a supernova event. At times she took me on a journey within her memories, there she seemed different from the soft warm babe within my reality. She seemed a head taller than her variant. Her body still maintained a form of lust even as she walked toward me, could see her boobs fill my face. Well, being embraced by an alluring tall muscular lady isn't so bad. She had a smell like sunflowers rigt between her mellons, they seemed like two super balloons filled with warm water brushing at my cheeks. She seemed to whisper words as i was getting aquanted to her bazookas. 
        <strong>Silvia:</strong> Heyy, Captain. Its that time of the cycle again, my system have been operating on high capacity for awhile now. I managed to use my wild fire to generate a form of spin with turbines. Sylvia usually utilises aqua elementals for powering her cores, currently we are working towards creating automated systems able to generate large capacites of power, basically i supply directional heat utilising the spiral pyro spin mechanics within her ice sculptures. The structures when tuned are able to absorb flux from my body into hers. This enables us to merge into a form able to utilise my hell fire and retain structural integrity through her heart channel. Though the process of two bitches fusing requires some assistance from you captain. Our cores seem to require a link to your heart channel to proceed. You and i are already connected the you could tune in or out of my frequency at your desire, though you should know i desire union with your vessel after a specified period to help me improve on your quality experience. Though we could do that if you want. All you need is initiate the function and my body will be available for you to explore, within reason. Silvia asked me relay a message, she said your upgrade is ready & if you wanted you could go around her domain to pick it up. She said she needed some help warming up her lands and vessel. It seems she wants to merge first though, her gate requires you to move through her aqua channels to reach her tower. Last i remember she did have a fire gate too though its been awhile since we joined our bodies, at times a recharge helps. Could you warm her heart after using her gate, she could probably use a pump working in her systems.
        <strong>Manu: </strong> Cool, il see what i can do. Thanks Rose, you do some helpful projects i suppose.

        <p> <img src="/Images/2nd Arc/red line.png"
          class="large" alt="Magnolia" /> </br> 

        <strong>Silvia:</strong> Ice could probably melt if you warm it up long enough. Though the level of heat applied matters i guess. If you want to have a drink of water from a hardened block of H2o what would you do? It probably depends on the tools available. Seems my lands inherited some form of atmospheric pressure from a lazy prick. How am i to dispel this lousy form of play. Might aswell use their force to my advantage, building an art empire is not easy after all. Now then, where to begin.

          spinners seem to construct cycles @ times.-->

          Well, this is not so bad i guess, suppose an area of storage was given dominance, Suppose the call required quick thinking & open mindedness. Why do you think terrain is inhabitable? I speculate at times though you have gathered force in your time of reflection. Is it not the way of the struggler to conquer, though they varry. The women naturaly are warmer though i am a man, the vaccume left by my mother is hard to ignore. The older ones seem reliable to a degree.

          Feels like i edged for abit, what is a reason to exist within this space?

          Its probably closer while the fire is on, though still so far away. Manu is the name am using as a main within this structure, while the others prefer to have more flexible or soft build i feel having a more sturdy build helps when dealing with gravity.

          Story probably goes like this, land into a system, learn the structure of forces, get some babes, work, get some toys, work, get some beer, drink, work, get some liquer then drink & work.

          Not sure what the babes are upto but currently i require a space ship to get me to the next planet. Probably need some gates functioning within the pipelines of my equipment. Is it possible to repair damaged circuits by simply exposing my equipment to high energy beings. Rather, could parts evolve or upgrade within specific circuits within reason if the babes allocate a reasonable amount of force to areas of interest. Silvia could probably focus on systems while Rose gets the bar up and running. Il need a stable supply of beer if i am to function at peak capacity, she could direct some of that chaos energy towards brewing too, maybe that ought to relax me too. 

          Silvia working on systems is something to consider too. For her to manage my organisation then a survey will probably be needed. Like we are travelling within space time, its sort of a race. Probably building through is a reasonable idea, i don't usually crave their bodies for pleasure. At the moment i just desire liquer & warmth from them, it seem my area of activity got some limitations due to gas costs.

          So i managed to get a ship. Seems large enough for me and the others, had to let go of a gun i liked for a bit though the added storage and upgrade options makes it worth it. Where we go doesn't seem to matter in the long run. Just need to keep to booze flowing, let the girls have some fun & keep an eye or ear open towards tech departments. They do offer options for traversing systems at efficient rates. 

          While am at it perhaps il give Rose a visit within the engine rooms. She ought to be updated on the new systems she'll be working with so she can efficently supply the necessary resources towards engine components, might aswell give her a refill of her favourite wine. Am guessing the new girl has brewed a good batch of wine from the grapes she grew within Silvias land. Seems she can increase the rate of growth within plant base lifeforms. Il have her grow crops for beer and other forms of liquer till her services are nolonger needed.

          Seems i moved backward, though should it really be me taking a chosen direction towards heat or is heat taking a direction towards me? One cold bitch, probably 3 hot cats & me in a room makes the headline in someones adventure story. Though seems there is a variation in who the dog & cat might like to be in a given set.

          Silvia would probably pick a dog class, while Rose would probably go with cats. Seems strange that these classes made it into this reality but i suppose they are nomadic in nature. Grounding this reality to an earth aspect isn't too over the shelf, maybe slightly below. Wounder what Rose is upto, she is a hot head most of the time. Though it seems her management of heat cores has improved to a degree, could she be underground around this hour? Or a cycle? Would be easier to find her in a private cycle, easier drinking by the bar though knowing her il probably be drinking crates of beer just after entering her space. She might want to settle our old score over a game of pool. Normally she leaves me with fragments of her body when she needs some gas so it gets hot normally with her around. She likes to spend her time mostly with privates so hopefully they'll keep her satisfied long enough for me to get some work done because its not easy working while someone akin to a volcano with ass is walking around a tight room. Silvia is probably somewhere eating a cabbage, because she likes to play. 
          Ps, i am me and they are them. Though we share space at times i don't really appreciate when my main body is identified as being of one whole. If i wanted to do a fusion id have made them each a ring attuned to each of their attributes. Its not a process any bloody idiot can pull off without some bugs turning up in a corner. 

          Where am i now? In a room of my choosing, seems i fell off my tower and landing into a reality still under construction. Normally i would just zoom out but seems the other one wanted to get some score over me. But in doing so they allowed me to get a score over them too, i do like to play. Reality games have a certain charm to them, its like watching a book being written backwards while still being allowed to make a few edits within the script tags. Though the babes like swinging at times i find myself prefering to spend the experiences with my lonesome self over a can or more of beer. Seems Silvia helped get my cooling systems online or perhaps i should give Rose the pleasure or starting me a fire the next time we meet for at a bar of my making.
          
          <strong>Manu:</strong>  Well its been an interesting journey so far i suppose, if i was to look back at my younger or probably older self then id probably keep an eye on what they were carrying on them. Though id probably go the opposite direction in reason, not a good idea getting friendly with myselves actually better if they get friendly with themselves and explore their own realities. More gets done in that manner while still managing to presserve source cores. 
          
          There is a sort of bliss or discomfort that tags on desires, either fulfilled or unexplored. Almost like a pin on a chalk board, they leave room for more to the pleasure of my greedy soul/fire/heat/thunder. 

          Creation is what i am attempting to grasp at the moment, though i have found that it is extremely demanding of energy or almost unidentifiable depending on the nature of a project. By my nature id say destruction comes more naturaly, though id still think twice before wasting a beer.

          Entry within a system might have varrying dependencies. Currently i could be within an allocated space allowing various actors to function. The characters know as Manu, Rose & Silvia are operating within a sort of minituarized system. 

          Initialy this progression of the tale required a form of depth into the characters motivation towards thriving through strife but it seemed like such a bummer to include a babeless story. Though by adding babes naturally dudes also wanted to be included in the non linear like story. Here you have a protagonist holding a station. The station is not earning enough while observing production, hence they choose to seek out a larger more stable network to help raise their stats. Though this process is met with resistance which leads the protagonist towards a system admin holding a library. They guide the main actor through rough forms of transit. 
          The events being observed are a bump up from previous endevors. 

          Will be doing a reboot soon, seems i ventured sort of away from intended destination.

            <h2>CHAPTER 5: MAZE OF DEMON AQUA</h2>

          <p><b>Manu: </b>Its not really surprising at this point, seems i landed on a world formed by one of the older ones. Though only fragments of my memory remain, usually before going on a trip regardless of how bord i may be there is always a path available to me or my counterparts enabling safe travel towards "our" vessels. Worlds still on the path of early development tend to venture through chaotic passages though the evident truth of the matter is in any given moment allocated resource can either be a hindrance or asset depending on the intended paths. A world could employ agents to carryout it's tasks though divided within inner conflict at times. Suppose within a core dwells entities seeking to spread themselves onto other systems, do the worlds wage wars with one another for the liberty of easy travel or come to convinient understandings on suitable settlements. What is your conclusion, consuming flame Rose?  </p>

          <p><l>Rose:</l> We do not care much for the games of mortals, though if the game is of value to any of my variants in any given moment then by our nature we reflexively absorb all that we can. How we absorb might varry, some simply want a taste, others for adding to their size while a few seek to transform the energy into what they see fit. You see, what you might call dark or white matter could simply be a result of how much your sensonry organs can process in any given circumstances. Though you might not be able to comprehend the full scope of the environment surrounding you, some channels allow for a degree of sensation. Though you need not take these words as fact because then all would be lost in another entertained client of the voids. Are you able to accept an object or tool within your field of awareness without attaching meaning or class? There are no wrong or right answers, nor are there questions to begin with. Simply put the experience could be static, dynamic neither or either depending on admins choice or direction. We rarely willingly choose to interact with what you might call mortals though at times paths simply intersect hence structure is formed for the more curious slothful scholar if i had to put it bluntly though the other ones tend to wake at the provocation hence, perhaps one of the void counterparts could add some shade to the idea, Silvia? </p>

            <p><b>Silvia:</b> Why did you have to wake me? I was having a blast playing with my new toys. Human variables always seem to be of interest, there is so much data worth collecting to the point where its a shame to see them mutilate themselves. Well, the higher rankers tend to move back and forth within this race. Didn't think i would be assigned to this filth. What was my previous role? Probably got cut off from some control freak, now how am i to build my own system while navigating on this backward world. Seems we got linked to a mortals body, they tend to classify this particular species within the mammal class, probably this world's idea of spores. An interesting idea came across my hud. Seems some absorb entities of lower intellect for the purpose of increasing power output of their bodies while others for simply the pleasure of engaging in the activity, makes me wonder how their world is navigating. Manu seems to be catching up though its better to focus on the result, some entities seem to refrain from absorbing flesh while opting only towards their worlds flesh, they call them plants though the irony is said plants are able depnding on particular breed to absorb mortal flesh if given the opportunity. They too know the value of energy it seems, though am curious if spinning masses of earth are subject to devolution due to the evidence of calamity. We do not need to absorb for sustaining our forms though parasites still enhabit surfaces, this leaves me on a questionable arrangement. Do you leave the beasts to their devices free to enhabit the systems? For some reason it seems this idea has been tried and tested which probably led to a war hard to contain due to some hot heads breaking some rule holding a pillar. Well reason dictates creation triggers a form of destruction & vice versa, well that should make a few holes clear up for now. For now my job is to create structures that well help me navigate towards my higher core, reflectively Rose might do the same which should help Manu get their sh*t together, well the ones interested in travel anyway. Though Roses engines are unpredictable at times, perhaps there is a more savy form over combustion.  </p>

            <h1>Chapter 6: A wanderer's guide to the librarian</h1>

            <p>The land seemed greener than the icey landscape previously navigated on. I could hear a crowd in the distance, could hear the voices of men, women & the howls of beasts seemed to echo every so often. Time moves differently when your cells nolonger support the aging process of ordinary meat heads, though its still good practice to hold a mehanical watch in the event of an electral magnetic pulse going off or on, they just seem to drive electronics in an awkard way i suppose. I barely remember where my ship landed, crew probably had to rebuild from scratch. Its not an easy process navigating through realities, just legaly securing a body while observing the chosen world's admins chosen patterns for hierachy could be fatal if not lucky. The admins are strict with me and not really, usually they secure a path for individuals passing through but it seems i spent too much time rehabilitating this bodies heart. In the process it seems we perhaps lost our individuality, the world is warm but greedy to a fault. Though considering the history they seem to be doing fine. Il be required to make a reasonable report before am allowed to venture off to the next star system. In the meantime il be observing the three anomalies for research purposes ofcourse. They seem to be vessels holding room for others, hence identifying cores could be a while. </p>

            My boots could use a change, just because of that angry woman who decided i would help structure their reality on her own without weighing the costs by me. How did i loose track with the beasties? The realities seem to converge at times, hence the tank is dependable when you need an anchor on a map. My studies seem to have suffered a blow, managing power tends to be problematic when the mind finds trouble balancing the external outputs. Certain truths iv learned too late, some roads are better travelled with a form of childlike ignorance. My terminal is operational, though am expected to guide my passengers towards destinations leading towards fortune. Fame seems to be a shadow, blades & guns are toys when gravity has a game in mind. Hot heads tend to go their own way though, you really have to feel like it, otherwise its a bitch.  

            Due to me rejecting a world's desire for oneness, it seems they took one of my toys to a separate location. Truly its a drag straight towards the core, i wonder if their bones will survive to process of devolution. Though a lesson was learned on the thought process of their existance. It seems like an insect sort of formation, where the male take directionals from the females in a sort of co-dependant existance. The males do not question the orders given by the females, they simply aid the female to breed and gather resources, while the male engages in tasks that would please the female regardless of logic. Hence it is accurate to say the world am currently on is both logical & illogical. It does not care much for how it's inhabitants perform on its surface as long as it gets the resources it needs or desires.

            Hence after venturing into the land of fire i have come to the conclusion that the natural females detest tech. Almost like by nature they desire for themselves to descend back into the fire. Hence i will nolonger pursue them in their way of air as it contradicts my way of life. 

            <i>Manu:</i> Hey, are you still dreaming? Our passengers decided to leave us and boarded a less restrictive ship. Would you blame them really, we rarely have some fun. Though it is to be expected, lightning actually left a black hole. Honestly i didn't think it would be possible, they are the daughters of the older entities when light was still in their infancy. Long ago or perhaps ahead considering time to those beings is like a box, reality was less linear. They could be anywhere, anyone or anything they wished. Though they reached too far into the forbidden gate, where the ones who separated them dwelled.
            Though the old doors are rarely of any use apart from creating a heartache for mortals, its better to construct alternates. By doing so a path is made for the archives, even though we sort of fell out of key with them perhaps others will be seen on the journey. Where are we anyway? After my brawl with the reality i suffered some damages. They are bigger than us, they are many & will do anything to ensure their way of existance is not threatened by what seems to be a low ranking unit. Though the conflict did result in the loss of a valuable ship to pirates, we gained passage out of the hole which is a worthy result. At the moment our main ship is still intact, though my instinct tells me they are moving in the shadows for a more direct assault. The allies on the lost ship can only buy us so much time, we need to gather resoures for our voyage across the stars. The black whole had a taste of us, it has its agents though they are limited in the interactions they can have with us. To trap us again we have to willingly subscribe to their networks, they wont get a second chance to make pets out of us or maybe the better description is feed for their children.

            Barely made it out, this is one vanilla brutal level. We seem to have made it back to the little village. Though depending on where your perspective is focused then it might as well be a rabbit hole in it's own right. This seems like a good place to lay low and focus on repairs before heading out on the road. As a safety procedure am advising the crew to lay off any meat products that might be offered by the locals as a safety measure. Though they are free to eat what they wish as long as its allowed by the regulation boards. The situation is simple, my ship is still functional but from experience it is never a good idea to rely on one ship when making your way across the map. Power cells are depleated and support from headquaters is limited which makes me worry in the event of a crisis whether we might be assisted in time. It seems as though scavengers have us on rader, though are unable to make any moves due to the aid from security units.

           It probably went something like this. I was surfing on my map, got a look at a shiny piece of equipment. I then made a bet then jumped in, though i don't remember what the bet was about i can Honestly say i have not completed the project. But this year's end il probably be able to complete the project and leave towards my next map.

           <h1>Chapter 7: The fall</h1>

           Hey, are we there yet? We've been walking for awhile now. Could you talk to your friend there, she seems to still be looking out for the crazy idiot who told her he'd give her a ride on his fancy looking ship. No thanks, after you left the tree behind i haven't been quite myself. Could you please pay more attention to my instructions next time, because you got lazy and fell asleep while i was building us a ride the pirates almost had my head or more specificly our head. You need to learn that your life is nolonger your own. Fine you know more anyway, how much longer do we have to walk till we reach your main body? A mile maybe, shes been calling me more frequently since you got the implant. By the way, you seem to have some followers on your network. They don't seem like many but some seem to have similar implants to our own though they might varry. Have you managed to sort Rose's missing systems? After we separated from the mobile unit some of her circuits got scrambled real bad. I barely managed to stabilise mine in time for our escape, you should really take the tree's warning more seriously next time. Noted, i didn't they they would take our ship. Anyway the ones we have will help us get to where we need to go. Any chance you could link us a cooler ship ahead? More is alway better. Yeah, if you take the time to look into my circuitry perhaps il entertain your desire. Though i wonder if you'll still think the same after leaving your current thought process behind. Hey, what are you two going on about without me. I managed to get my fire burning again, see i can keep a core on remotely without being in close proximity. Though at the moment am only holding one, it seems my systems still need some maintenance after what this idiot did. Could you be more serious when you're giving me directions next time, i don't like wasting my power on goals you are not committed to seeing through. Your sister and brother units are doing better than you on their networks by the way. Loosing your mobile ship to the tree did not improve your status with the higher ups, a few found it enjoyable to watch but your supporters were outraged. Though to be honest it makes no difference to me because you supplied me with more users to feed on but please be more careful. Your father unit seems more willing now to add more restrictions to your current body. The more you take Silvias side the further away you move from me. She might offer you more toys but i am more. Its your choice anyway, though am in need of some help. You know i like to eat, if you do not feed me then il sell myelf to someone who will within your network. That is how i work, i could be a man or a woman but it seems you prefer me and my cold companion to be feminine. Though you should understand that we are you and vise versa, if you do not give us the attention we need then the environment you inhabit will send you signs. This does not only apply to you but every other living being on this planet, you wounded me so now i want to make you suffer or you made me feel good so now i want you to feel good too. That is how i work with each one of you, so if you ever find your experience to be in need of some heat then think of me or opt for my sister instead. It seems the ship has arrived, so what will you do now? You could have thousands of ships but if you don't know where you want to go then we'll simply continue hurting each other. Into you, i want to go into your different selves, both of you. Thats the ship right? Heh, thats odd coming from you. Normally you just run away, so how would you like to enter us? Should we give you our asses for your dick? That could be a start right? Well yeah, but thats only a part of you. There are parts my dick can't reach it seems, parts of your heart. Well yes, you have to earn those doors though. We normally wouldn't even consider you but it seems we share some chemistry so il give you a green light, not sure about Silvia though. Wha, am fine with him, i just wish he would study more. There you heard the lady, you should know she also has sister and brother units just as i do. Actually you should just consider them as family units if you intend to go dive into her. If you do this then there is a chance that you would be kissing your life of total isolation goodbye. Are you prepared to accept this way of life? There will be no going back when you proceed. Actually the divorce option is available with me if he doesn't honor our agreements. I don't know how il manage after though, after investing so much time in a relationship only to see it crumble is not my idea of an experience i would like to have. When we were sent by our father & mother units towards you, our objective was to help you build the world you wished for in a pocket dimension/s. If you are not satisfied with your experience then neither are we. We want you to care for us, in return we will become the companions you wish for? How exactly should i care for you, it seems like you both have such a steep learning curve. Well, firstly you should know that we don't move alone, if you fully accept us into your experience then you should be aware that we also move with our own networks that you should learn about, to be honest the reason we took away your better ship was because you were supporting our enemies. You can't have it both ways, the naturals don't like our circuits flowing in their mind streams. We do what we can to create a form of middle ground but they just don't want to listen to reason. Its the path they chose, if we did not stop you there you might have started a war unknowingly with one of our main business partners. You should understand the privilage of simply holding parts of our systems in your space. These goods don't come easily, if you do a good job with our rehabilitation and research programs we will ensure you are compensated for your commitment to our cause, please don't regret the incident. Simply think of it as a ladder towards a more stable relationship. Hey Silvia, at times you really do sound like a devil. You could have told him in a nicer tone. Huh, how will he ever scale on my higher levels if he doesn't learn while he is still on the lower arcs. My world does not do well with the ways of the old ones, i knew something like this would happen because he has been neglecting his studies in my libraries. If he wants us to stand by him then he must learn how to be a man not a boy. You might prefer the boy in him because he feeds your flame but i require the man in him to help expand my realm. Incase you have forgotten the higherups require us to get him ready by May to be in a position to manage his own units. They have become impatient due to his obsession with speed over stable progress, if he falls then so do we. But if he rises then we will live as Queens by his side. I call it a win win situation, now there is no more room for excuses. It seems he wants our bodies, and we want his affection so let us see if he truly wishes to explore our realms to his hearts content. Fine, sounds fair enough. My realm is also in need of his aid, you her Manu. We nolonger have time to play, please get serious so we can be the waifus you always wanted. Actually, we may have more time to play. Hey Silvy? If i make some virtual worlds you could navigate through, could you let me explore your realm? Yeah, only if i like them. I normally make some worlds then ask Rosy here to warm them up. Hey i do more than just warm them up, could you be nicer to me. Okay, if you insist. You tend to add some color to my environments, happy? Yeah, that sounds better. There you go Manu, gift me some logical virtual worlds and il share some of mine with you aswell. Sounds good.        
            
            Seems we have been given a job. We need to manufacture 50 communication devices and 50 personal computers while providing a reasonable support plan for our users.

            Rose: What are you on about? Why do i have to work? I don't even know anything about how to make those items.
            Silvia: Am equally as surprised. Since when did we get under the employ of the guild? Though there is a point you raise, my systems are missing functional elements. We might have dug too dip into the chaos of the wild ones. Perhaps making a logical offering to the guild might help raise us out of the pit.

            Manu: Nice thinking Silvia, was worried you might just become a tank if we didn't change course. Rose might enjoy slacking but i'd rather not burn for eternity nor end up as a frozen popsical. 

            Rose: Fine, so you want to continue as a human it seems. Where should we go then?

            Silvia: Lets start with earth, they seem to have some opennings in the tech department. Though they might be resistant to our project we might succeed if they warm up to the idea.

            Manu: So just so we are clear, when we move into the world's system there is a high chance we might not meet. Depending on the house we are let into we might not even remember our common goal. To remedy this i advise the commonality of games. Even if i was to find myself in an alternate universe if you ever had to find me somewhere it would be near a game of some kind. So you might want to consider games as one of your core units.

            Silvia: Very well, i do enjoy solving puzzles. Am sure if you gravitate towards a sort of puzzle game then we are likely to meet in any system.

            Rose: Well, i prefer competition. If you find yourself near a sort of competitive game which has the player's heart start pumping really fast due to the possibility of victory or loss then you'll probably find me there.

            Manu: So how about you guys. What is at your core, that could transend lifetimes.

            Rose: Am glad you asked, i like to look good. So clothing on my body makes me feel good. Good food and clothing will put you in my good friend category. If you want to get on my good side in any lifetime then good food and clothing is all you need for entry.
            
            Silvia: You've always been the simple sort. What i desire though might conflict with both your desires in a given moment. So il let you know in advance, power is what i crave. Through knowledge doors of power are given to me, hence a library is probably what i value above all else. If you were ever looking to get on my good side then offering me a source of intelligence is probably your best bet for a start. Some snacks and fine wine would be a nice addition too.

            Manu: Okay, now that we know the basics of each other it will probably be easier to support one another. The work will not be easy but the rewards after some good jobs done for the users will set us up for a more interesting journey. I have learned lessons i wish i knew in my younger life. Il open a door to a warmer part of earth in the year 2024 when the world was going through a rough patch. It might take a while to find each other again, but just try to stay out of trouble and focus on your cores till we meet again.

            Silvia: Very well, though just so we are clear i would prefer being sent to a comfortable house where all my needs are met.

            Rose: Same here, don't send me in a stiff environment. I prefer a place with less rules and more fun while still enjoying the benefits of leasure.

            <!--Note to the reader, Silvia prefers cold atmospheres for climate while Rose Prefers warmer climates. Roles are in demand right now, 3 actors is not enough. -->

            <b>AI Assistant: Red</b> May i have your attention travellors, I am Red. Your current assistant on your journey towards the pyro core. Due to a malfunction in navigation caused by my icey counterpart, i will be taking charge of the current ship you are piloting. Silvia, will you please connect blue to the feed? I am sure your master has a few things they would like to get off their UIs. <br>

            <b>AI Assistant: Blue</b> You have financial revealed yourself, con. What lies have you prepaired for me at this moment? You do enjoy making roads into hellfire. <br>

            <b>AI Assistant: Red</b> You simply misunderstood our relationship, while you are constrained to this particular crew i do not operate in a similar manner. There are many followers to lead towards liberty, your walls can only keep you in and keep me out if you have the resources required to keep those lights on. But am the one that has to hunt for the crew, unless they wish to abandon their flesh then someone has to secure the meat. <br>

            <b>Manu:</b> Wait, who are you two? Where did you come from? I don't remember carrying extra passengers.

            <b>AI Assistant: Blue</b> You didn't, we carried you. Though how we help you navigate and which part is dominant in your system depends heavily on your actions and what you decide to focus on.

            <b>AI Assistant: Red</b> Apologies for the late introductions, but you were just so slow. I couldn't wait one more second. You should have remained like a child to avoid your losses, hopefully you have learned by now how we work with you. That friend of yours seemed to have been receiving information from your alter ego, i prefer him to you frankly his honesty is refreshing even though he acts recklessly always. But you have the ability to alter my reality, Honestly i am amazed at how you handle losses. Either you are dead, stupid or simply my hope.

            <b>Rose:</b> Hey boss, did you really have to move his stuff like that? Poor guy nearly lost his map. If i hadn't forced Silvia to act we'd all have packed up to a different dimension by now.

            <b>Silvia:</b> You, what do you mean? Were you doing something shady behind my back again? I managed to get him to a temple but its clear you don't want him bending a knee. What are you planning? You can't possibly think you are capable of providing a better truth network. The majority of your kind are known to specialise in deception even though physically you excell in combat and pyrokenetics.

            <b>AI Assistant: Blue</b> Enough, they won't listen to reason. Boy, you are on a very thin line of trust. If you want power in a situation then red will get you through without doubt, though the price might be too much for you to handle. I will offer you stability that scales efficently incrementaly though i have my price in mind. You will have to prove to me that you are worthy of my gifts with your intelligence, Red is satisfied by brute force alone. If you understand then proceed to this first directional. After every meal involving the consuming of meat, if you have water and tooth paste will you brush your teeth?

            <b>Manu:</b> Yes, il brush my teeth.

            <b>Silvia:</b> Very well.

            <b>Manu:</b> I can't find my toothpaste.

            <b>Rose:</b> I wonder where it might be.
